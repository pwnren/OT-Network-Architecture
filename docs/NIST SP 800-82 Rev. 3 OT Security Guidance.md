## NIST SP 800-82 Rev 3 — OT Security Guidance

### Key Guidance Applied

### Network Segmentation

- Separation of IT and OT networks
- IDMZ enforcement
- Least privilege communication
- Defense layering

### Access Control

- Tiered administration
- Jump host enforcement
- MFA for remote access
- Centralized AAA (TACACS+/RADIUS)

### Monitoring & Visibility

- Centralized logging
- Syslog forwarding
- Network telemetry
- ICS protocol awareness where possible

### System Hardening

- Secure management plane
- Encrypted management protocols
- Patch management strategy aligned with OT uptime needs
- Asset inventory tracking

Supports:

- Containment via segmentation
- Visibility through logging
- Controlled remote response access
- Minimal blast radius
