## IEC 62443 Zones & Conduits, Security Levels

### Zones & Conduits Mapping

IEC 62443 defines zones as logical or physical groupings of assets with similar security requirements and conduits as controlled communication paths between zones

### Zones in This Architecture

| Purdue Level | Zone Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Level 5 | Enterprise Zone | Corporate IT systems, identity services |
| Level 3.5 | Industrial DMZ | Brokered communications between IT and OT |
| Level 3 | Operations Zone | OT application servers, historians |
| Level 2 | Supervisory Zone | HMI, SCADA supervisory systems |
| Level 1 | Basic Control Zone | PLCs and controllers |
| Level 0 | Process Zone | Sensors and actuators |

### Conduits

Conduits are enforced through:

- Firewalls between Purdue levels
- ACL enforcement on Layer 3 boundaries
- VRF segmentation
- Jump hosts for administrative access
- Protocol allow-listing
- Default-deny communication policies

Only explicitly required communications are permitted between zones

### Security Levels (SL)

IEC 62443 defines Security Levels (SL1–SL4) based on threat capability

| Security Level | Description | Application in Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| SL1 | Protection against casual or accidental misuse | Applied to Level 0–1 networks |
| SL2 | Protection against intentional violation using simple means | Level 2 supervisory systems |
| SL3 | Protection against sophisticated attackers | Level 3 and IDMZ |
| SL4 | Protection against highly sophisticated attackers | Rare in most ICS deployments |

Security controls increase moving from Level 0 → Level 5 boundaries
